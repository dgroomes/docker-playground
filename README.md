# docker-playground

ðŸ“š Learning and exploring Docker <https://www.docker.com/>.

### `basic/`

A basic "hello world" example of Docker that starts a container, executes a command inside of it, then stops it.

See the README in [basic/](basic/).

## WishList

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* Add Docker Compose examples
* Add non-Docker examples. (I hardly know anything about non-Docker container technology)
* Add an example showing a "depends-on" relationship using a shell script instead of Docker Compose (because Docker Compose
  doesn't support the "depends_on" property since a long time)
